# epileptic_seizure_model
A computational model reproduces results from Taylor et al (2014) [A Computational Study of Stimulus Driven Epileptic Seizure Abatement]([https://example.com/docs](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0114316)) 

## Seizure and background state
Using the approach described in the paper, I run the model three times with varied initial states to reproduce background-to-seizure-to-background transitions.
